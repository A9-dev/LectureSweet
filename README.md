# LectureSweet

This is our submission for the ECSS CommunityHack, which is a suite of tools for a lecturer to use to interact and monitor their students during a lecture. This currently provides a chat where students can ask questions, movement calculation to monitor sleeping students and an "understanding" display where students can submit their current understanding of the content the lecturer is talking about, helping the lecturer decide if they should go over the content again.

This is a full stack web app built using the MERN stack and is easily scalable for the addition of more tools.
